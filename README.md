Wallbox Test Implementation
In each Python script you can find test developed with Pytest library. For this reason is suggested to install pytest library: pip install pytest
Each Test case is described inside the script.

# Part 1: Unit Testing
1) For Poblem #1 I choose two vectors of integer that can have different length.
2) Fill the path of Problem #2 with folder in your PC.
3) For Poblem #3 I choose two vectors of integer with value 0 or 1 as specifications. The tests monitor also if array have same length.
